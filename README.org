* Purpose
  This code is an attempt at implementing the algorithm presented in the paper Twice Ramujan Sparsifiers in octave.
  The paper can be found [[https://arxiv.org/pdf/0808.0163.pdf][Right Here]]
  
  
* How to run
  To run this code simply run the sparseScript.m file. This is a simple script that generates a random graph with user defined parameters. These are
  - n: number of verices of the orignal graph
  - pr: Denisity of edges. This should be a number in (0,1) and is the probabality between any two nodes there will be an edge
  
As of writing I'm not convinced my code is correct.
